# Gabremoku Cloud

**Gabremoku Cloud** is an advanced technical indicator for TradingView designed to detect high-probability breakouts during phases of market compression.

Inspired by the Ichimoku system, it combines visual cloud elements and momentum filters to trigger precise entry signals — visually marked as "Bite marks" on the chart.

## 🧠 Why the name *Gabremoku*?

The name is a pseudo-Japanese fusion, inspired by the famous Ichimoku indicator. It evokes the image of ravenous eyes ready to bite — each signal being a precise visual "bite" on the chart, aimed at capturing breakout moves with surgical timing.
